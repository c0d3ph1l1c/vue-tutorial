  <!-- Rendering plain HTML elements is very fast in Vue, but sometimes you might have a component that contains a lot of static content. In these cases, you can ensure that it’s only evaluated once and then cached by adding the v-once directive to the root element. -->

  <!-- Once again, try not to overuse this pattern. While convenient in those rare cases when you have to render a lot of static content, it’s simply not necessary unless you actually notice slow rendering – plus, it could cause a lot of confusion later. For example, imagine another developer who’s not familiar with v-once or simply misses it in the template. They might spend hours trying to figure out why the template isn’t updating correctly. -->
